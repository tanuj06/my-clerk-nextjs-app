# Next.js + TypeScript + Clerk Authentication

This is a demo project to integrate **Clerk Authentication** with **Next.js** using **TypeScript**.

## Features

- **Clerk Authentication**: Supports Sign-Up, Sign-In, and User Management.
- **Pages Router**: Uses Next.js pages directory for routing.
- **Login as Landing Page**: Unlike other code examples where the login form is typically on a separate start page, this application has the login page as the **starting point** of the application. Upon visiting the app, users are directed straight to the login screen.
- **Protected Routes**: Pages like `/profile` are protected by Clerk authentication.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-clerk-nextjs-app.git
   cd my-clerk-nextjs-app
   ```
